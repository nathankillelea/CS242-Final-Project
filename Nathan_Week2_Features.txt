1. Wave System (Set # of enemies spawn per wave. Wave ends when all enemies are defeated. Waves become increasingly more difficult)
2. World larger than the screen
3. Implement Model-View-Controller design?? eh
4. Implement 2 unique enemies (One that shoots projectiles at the player, one that does something else such as boss)
5. Maybe improved hit detection
6. Pause and restart
7. Create world object??
