1. Wave System (Set # of enemies spawn per wave. Wave ends when all enemies are defeated. Waves become increasingly more difficult) (almost done, needs 1-2 more enemy types)
2. World larger than the screen (needs to be fixed right and bottom) ✔
3. Implement 2 unique enemies (One that shoots projectiles at the player, one that does something else such as boss)
4. Create world object, maybe doesn't count
5. Mini map?
6. Improved hit detection
7. Game Over + Restart ✔

need to add COMMENTS to my STUFF and TESTING and commit to gitlab and svn as project2
