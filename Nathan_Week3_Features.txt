1. Refactor Main into a Game class and add Pause option
2. Add a MiniMap that displays player, enemy, and environment object locations
3. Randomly generate objects/populate map and added gun sounds (maybe add more, weapons spawn from crates or something else?)
4. Final boss (unique attacks/charge) or something else
